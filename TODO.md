- sheep dog spawns for sheep_farm at home only
- change sheep_dog behavior to attack-on-sight
- raid of goblins sometimes spawns 10 goblins! (might be when they switch to selfish mode?) spawn sheep farm in their behavior change trigger
- z-index of player vs goblin
- rename backpack to inventory and make hotkey "I"
- hover over items in backpack shows description, reuse build descriptions
- resource: vine
- running over zone trigger is not obvious
- goblin raid shooting arrows animation messed up
- punching to my left doesn't hit sheep?
